Custom widget is a special kind of <<.xL procedure Procedures>> that can be called using the same syntax as widgets.

Custom widgets can also be used to override built-in ~JavaScript widgets to customise their behaviour.

Custom widgets are usually defined with the pragma: `\widget`:

<$my.widget attribute="xxxx"/>
