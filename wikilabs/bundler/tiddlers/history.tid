V 0.2.0 - 2021-01-28

* Add a new tab to the tiddler (i)nfo area
** The "Bundle" tab contains a "list", "export" and "open in ~AdvancedSearch" buttons

* Improve configuration panel
** We have all important settings on 1 page now
** The config panel can be reached from the "bundles" tab in the sidebar

* Make `prefix[--- ]]` the standard for tiddler titles, that are used as comments
** It's easy to read and we didn't get complains for 2 years, since the suggestion was made

* $:/StoryList*, $:/HistoryList*, "$:/state/*" and "$:/temp/*" are importable now
** This will allow us to work with multiple stories

* We use `subfilter` instead of `enlist` now
** This unifies simple-list and filtered-list handling

* Add a plugin icon {{$:/plugins/wikilabs/bundler/icon}}

* Slightly improved docs ;) [[Tips and Tricks]]

* Known Issues!
** System tiddlers are always selected atm. This will change in the future, but we need core support here!

* The plugin overwrites [[$:/core/modules/upgraders/system.js]] now
